At some point I stoped fearing to walk on the Everfree.

That may be one of the reasons why       built his shack in here-- its beasts know better than to attack us. Besides, his snores got more potent as the years went by. By the time he built this no one living in or near        's castle could sleep, including          herself.

I stop short of knocking the door when I hear him playing a lute inside, and instead wait for him to notice I am outside.

 "Applejack?" He calls after a few minutes, "Come in."

 "Took you long enough." I joke as I push the door open, "What'd ya want to talk about?"
 
 "My sense of smell still isn't quite right." A small flame flares from his nostrils, expelling ashes in the process, as a demostration, "You know how it is."

 "I really don't." I walk closer to him, closing the door with a hindleg.
 
 "Well, don't eat wood by mistake."
 
 "I won't if you stop avoiding my question." I hit him on the ribs with an elbow, "Out with it, is this about how          had to travel without you?"
 
 "Nah, she can handle herself." He puts his lute on the table, "What worries me is the opposite."
 
 "Huh?"
 
 "Do you remember when Tirek hurt Flutters?" He asks bluntly.
 
I hesitate, but nod. It' not something any of us likes to dwell in.

 "And what she did to Tirek?"

He had to go there, didn't he.

 "I've been in enough fights to know when someone wants to kill, AJ. If I hadn't stopped her..." His voice fades, "I am         's paladin, and that doesn't mean I protect her. That means I keep her from going too far."

I don't answer to that.
 
 "You'll start your travel in a moon or so, right?" I nod. "Have you told the others yet?"
 
 "I planned to do it tomorrow."
 
 "Good." He pauses. "I wanted to tell you this before you took off,          has been getting worse lately."
 
 "Define lately."
 
 "Last year or so. You were bussy helping with the new village near Appleloosa, but she's doing the teeth thing again."
 
 "Gritting 'em?."
 
 "She's grinding them in her sleep too, and getting headaches. I haven't gotten her to say anything, you know how she gets."
 
 "Have you talked with Luna or Celestia?"
 
 "Celestia's been too bussy lately, But Luna..." He hesitates, "Luna's worried about it. She gave me something," He expels flame onto his claw, a note left in it, "Do you have any idea of what this is?"
 
I read it. My eyes open wide.

 "She gave me full autorithy to demote and restrain Twilight if I think it's a necesity." He makes it dissapear with another burst of flame, "I don't know for sure what is that Luna thinks is going on, but it's serious enough that she gave me higher legal autorithy than Twilight and Cadance put together. At this moment only you fiv--" His expression is pained for a moment, "*four* together, or the royal sisters themselves, could stand against me in court."

I try to answer, but the words just won't come.

 "I think Luna is worried that Twilight is going Nightmare Moon." He falls completely sile--
 

 "--ack?" Ludwig pokes me in the back.
