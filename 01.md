At some point I stoped fearing to walk on the Everfree.

That may be one of the reasons why       built his shack in here-- its beasts know better than to attack us. Besides, his snores got more potent as the years went by. By the time he built this no one living in or near        's castle could sleep, including          herself.

I stop short of knocking the door when I hear him playing a lute inside, and instead wait for him to notice I am outside.

 "Applejack?" He calls after a few minutes, "Come in."

 "Took you long enough." I joke as I push the door open, "What'd ya want to talk about?"
 
 "My sense of smell still isn't quite right." He flares some flame from it, expelling ashes in the process, as a demostration, "You know how it is."

 "I really don't." I walk closer to him, closing the door with a hindleg.
 
 "Well, don't eat wood by mistake."
 
 "I won't if you stop avoiding my question." I hit him on the ribs with an elbow, "Out with it, is this about how          had to travel without you?"
 
 "Nah, she can handle herself." He puts his lute on the table, "What worries me is the opposite."
 
 "Huh?"
 
 "Do you remember when Tirek hurt Flutters?"
