Luna was silent. Shouting as much as she wanted to would've been a waste of energies.

Her mind was ablaze, a flurry of instincts working together under the careful supervision of centuries' worth of experience. Telekinetic tug, telekinetic push, jump, *keep running*, blades sweeping and shields blocking, kick and bite and buck and charge onto, *keep moving* was the idea that marked her every action. Cut the head as a sign of compassion. Kill the wounded before they hurt too much or are healed. Protect allies so that they can protect back. *Live*.

At last, silence.

Feeling completely numb, she looked around.

The only people alive were her soldiers, her little ponies.

 "Godoi." She called.

 "My lady?" Came its voice from the ceiling.

 "Is there any pocket left?"

 "This was the last one, Princess."

The numbness started to go away, replaced by the pain of a hundred little wounds.

 "How long has it been?"

 "You last were unconscious two and a half days ago, and slept a week ago. I advice R n' R, as your ponies call it."

Luna shook her head and started walking to her quarters, some of her soldiers trailing behind.

 "Give me today's report." She asked curtly when a pegasus, Gale, walked up to her.

 "Medics are already taking care of the wounded. Three didn't make it." He gulped. "Wet Stream, Akero, and Sunbeam."

 "See to that they receive proper burial, with posthumous commendation." Luna was silent for a moment, her armored boots clicking against the black marble floor, "Do let Akero's mother drink her tea before telling her."

Godot spoke up again, "Princess, I must insist in that you rest properly." He said harshly. He used harsh tones like a warrior would use a battle shout.

Luna shook her head again, despite wanting to. "There's something left to do."
